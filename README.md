# Course Project: Fundamentals of Data Science and Machine Intelligence

## Overview

This repository is part of an ongoing course project for the **"Fundamentals of Data Science and Machine Intelligence"** course. The project aims to apply core principles of data science and machine learning to solve a real-world problem or explore a significant research question.

## Objectives

* Understand and apply key data science techniques such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
* Explore machine learning algorithms and analyze their performance on selected datasets.
* Gain hands-on experience with end-to-end ML pipelines, from data collection to result interpretation.

## Current Status

âœ… Problem Statement Finalized
âœ… Dataset Identified and Collected
ðŸ”„ Data Preprocessing In Progress
â¬œ Exploratory Data Analysis
â¬œ Model Development and Evaluation
â¬œ Final Report and Presentation

> **Note**: This project is currently in progress. The repository will be updated regularly as development continues.
